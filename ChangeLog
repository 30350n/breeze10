V5.14
---------
 * Upgraded for Breeze 5.14 with its new shadows.
 * Completely sharp button symbols that consist of horizontal and vertical lines.

V5.13
---------
 * First version, made out of Breeze 5.13 and BreezeBlurred with new options.
 * Set the font style name for KDE to render it correctly. I don't know why KDE needs that while LXQt doesn't.

 * Added flatness to the exception list.
 * Made inactive macOS-like buttons gray.
 * Added a setting for button spacing.
 * Added opacity override to the exception dialog.
