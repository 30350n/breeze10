 * Applied the upstream patch https://phabricator.kde.org/D16596.

 * Also include borders in the opacity override.

V5.13
---------
 * First version, made out of Breeze 5.13 and BreezeBlurred with new options.

 * Added a setting for button spacing.
 * Added opacity override to the exception dialog.
